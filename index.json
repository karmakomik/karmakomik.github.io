From a pedagogical view, such a problem can be tackled with the help of elements of gamification, like giving real time feedback on performance, leaderboards for identifying the best performers (in the classroom or workplace) and additional features that enables instructors or supervisors to add and customize scenarios of their choosing. This problem of optimization of material use has been tackled by the textile, sheet metal cutting and carpentry cutting machine industries for many decades and is still an active area of research in the fields of computational geometry and operations research. In a way the goal of this project is to translate this kind of “computational” efficiency found in the automation industry into human workers which could prove useful in developing nations.\nThe problem of optimizing the arrangement of the component pieces needed to be made quantifiable (for the scoring to work) while reflecting real world usefulness as well. So it was recharacterized as a problem of finding the Maximum Empty (axis-parallel) Rectangle (MER) that can be fit into the empty space remaining in the workpiece after arranging the component pieces. Though in the real world, one would not get neat rectangular pieces as leftover from the cutting process, by considering the MER we can reasonably quantify the leftover material’s utility for future use.\nShape \u0026amp; Scenario Editors \r\rShape editor\r\r\r​The shape editor lets the instructor add contour information of the shape of each wood piece into the system, which is mapped to the chilitag placed on the piece. The contour data is stored into a YML file as (x,y) offsets from the position of the chilitag’s center. Image processing tasks here were implemented using OpenCV. ​The scenario module lets the instructor associate a group of shapes to a scenario using their associated AR tags. This helps in providing the scoring metrics and a simple hint system as shown below.\n\r\rBending a square shape\r\r\rGame Game ​: The objective of the game is to maximize the size of the Maximum Empty Rectangle (MER) that can be formed from the area left empty.

What underlies an acknowledged dearth of skilled labor, impeding India from reaching its potential, are issues of quality, standardization, and accessibility to skill development, especially to and within existing vocational training programs. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reiterated the urgent need for improved inclusion in skill development among socially and economically vulnerable groups to strengthen the prospect of decent employment and income generation, as indicated in the sub-goal of SDG 4 on quality education. Skill development practitioners and academicians recognize information communication and technology (ICT) as a critical component in addressing issues of inclusivity, quality, and standardized skill development. Discussion of ICT-integrated TVET primarily takes place in the context of formal training; however, a significant portion of skill development in India takes place along the lifelong learning continuum, outside of the formal context. This chapter, therefore, takes a wider perspective to review how ICT is reforming TVET delivery practices in India across formal, nonformal, and open and distance learning settings.","tags":null,"title":"Role of ICT in Enhancing Scale, Quality, and Reach of TVET in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parameswari Anitha","Sooraj K Babu","R Unnikrishnan","Rao R Bhavani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"18a3215441af6f02168af3cb1215ee39","permalink":"/publication/anitha-2018-scratching/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.448503Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anitha-2018-scratching/","section":"publication","summary":"Technologies for development have great potential in accelerating the socio-economic progress of disadvantaged communities.

The test-retest reliability of the balance platform is evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of the measurement (SEM). Thirty healthy individuals performed quiet standing with eyes opened/eyes closed and activities of daily living for twenty seconds. The center of pressure (COP) path length, mean velocity and range of displacement are computed to demonstrate device consistency across different trials. We also discuss the results of a pilot study on the utility of the device among clinical practitioners of physical medicine and rehabilitation.","tags":null,"title":"Design and development of balance training platform and games for people with balance impairments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Jose","R Unnikrishnan","Delmar Marshall","Rao R Bhavani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"072b9204ddb76871c293cb4c0f1dff88","permalink":"/publication/jose-2016-haptics/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.411601Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jose-2016-haptics/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the design and computational modelling of a virtual simulator of a multitool, for training vocational skills in a hands-on way.

It provides a metaphor and gameplay for embodied and tangible games, and creates a soft early ramp up into the conceptual and digital space of learning to code. We discuss the urgency of digital inclusion for Indian rural children, with reference to technology as an amplifier which they need to learn to direct. We contrast the grounded, embodied style of Haathi Mera Saathi with the current crop of mini-languages and coding games, with particular emphasis on the need for physicality and tangibility in the very early stages of learning to code. We further discuss our experience conducting workshops for students from the tribal and rural belts of India, where we see HMS as an effective approach for taking them from a state of having no background in computers or computing, to a state where they create interactive applications in a Java based environment. Recommendations are given for researchers interested in working with rural village children.","tags":null,"title":"Of elephants and nested loops: How to introduce computing to youth in rural india","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Ranjith","Nagarajan Akshay","R Unnikrishnan","Rao R Bhavani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"792ed648bd68d312fb3a8d399ca9e9b4","permalink":"/publication/ranjith-2014-yourself/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.372705Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ranjith-2014-yourself/","section":"publication","summary":"Human motor skill training forms a large portion of the curriculum for any vocational education and training course. Construction personnel such as carpenters, plumbers and masons require long hours of training in order to gain expertise and workmanship to perform complex tasks skillfully. Poor skill in the use of tools results in sub-optimal outcome; compromised work quality and consumes additional cost. In this paper, we describe the design of a novel do-it-yourself educational tool that is built using low cost materials, open source software and hardware, the designs for which are freely downloadable. This educational toolkit uses haptic technology to augment the need for realism and is used to provide skill training in the use of vocational tools. The aim is to generate interest in vocational education and to provide greater accessibility for base level skill training.","tags":null,"title":"Do it yourself educational kits for vocational education and training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Jose","R Unnikrishnan","Delmar Marshall","Rao R Bhavani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"c226cc7add51288ec36c89cda4513dc2","permalink":"/publication/jose-2014-haptic/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.37869Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jose-2014-haptic/","section":"publication","summary":"The objective of this work is to augment actual handson conventional vocational training workshop with simulated training using virtual haptic simulations as part of computerbased vocational education and training.

This is an unconventional attempt at designing a multi-tool haptic trainer that could potentially replace traditional training tools and materials in the primary stages of vocational skill training. After an exhaustive analysis of all the tools used in the various vocational trades of the construction industry, we categorized and sorted the tools based on their properties and functions. Using this information, we designed Amrita Progressive Training Assistance using Haptic simulation (APTAH), a cost effective haptic simulator that can train the use of over nineteen hand-held and powered tools used in several vocations. The simulator provides audio, visual and haptic cues that can help the novice master the use of the tools in the absence of a human trainer. This paper also discusses the preliminary trials conducted to study training effectiveness of the haptic simulator proposed.","tags":null,"title":"Design and evaluation of a Haptic simulator for vocational skill Training and Assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Bhavani","Srividya Sheshadri","R Unnikrishnan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"cdfcfc2f3c08aa28b0fc1a96e09c9c78","permalink":"/publication/bhavani-2010-vocational/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.350797Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bhavani-2010-vocational/","section":"publication","summary":"Vocational Education and Training (VET) helps bridge the gap between limited education and gainful employment. However, it is difficult to make VET readily accessible to economically and educationally challenged communities. To meet this challenge, we introduce a novel solution that adds unique elements to the realms of education technology: vocational education enhanced through both multimedia and haptic technology. This paper will present conceptual elements of revolutionary haptic technology to be applied in vocational education settings as well as present two different vocational training tested in the field using multimedia and haptic technologies. Through the application of multimedia, virtual reality and haptic technology to VET, we demonstrate that this enhanced vocational education and training has the capacity to convey complex concepts and skill sets to illiterate and semi-literate individuals. We also show the vast potential for applicability of such enhanced VET across India, and the resulting promise of increased employment and improved livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of people.","tags":null,"title":"Vocational education technology: rural India","type":"publication"}]
