The objective of this between-subjects study was to (a) investigate the effectiveness of immersive virtual reality for training participants in the ‘buzz-wire’ fine motor skill task compared to physical training and (b) investigate the link between participants’ arousal with their improvements in task performance. Physiological arousal levels in the form of  electro-dermal activity (EDA) and ECG (Electrocardiogram) data were collected from 87 participants, randomly distributed across the two conditions. Results indicated that VR training is as good as, or even slightly better than, training in physical training in improving task performance. Moreover, the participants in the VR condition reported an increase in self-efficacy and immersion, while marginally significant differences were observed in the presence and the temporal demand (retrieved from NASA-TLX measurements). Participants in the VR condition showed on average less arousal than those in the physical condition. Though correlation analyses between performance metrics and arousal levels did not depict any statistically significant results, a closer examination of EDA values revealed that participants with lower arousal levels during training, across conditions, demonstrated better improvements in performance than those with higher arousal. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VR in training and the potential of using arousal and training performance data for designing adaptive VR training systems. This paper also discusses implications for researchers who consider using biosensors and VR for motor skill experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Investigating the effectiveness of immersive VR skill training and its link to physiological arousal","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"The Scrum Simulator (ScrumSim) is an interactive multiplayer VR simulation that places the participant in a virtual collaboration environment, in order to train them in the use of the Scrum project management methodology.

Immersive VR (IVR) training is adopted in many diverse settings, yet little systematic work currently exists on how researchers have applied it for industrial skills training and if it holds the potential to be applied remotely. In this review, 78 representative studies were analysed to answer three key questions: Is IVR an effective training method for industrial skills training? How is research in this field applied? And how can we make IVR training more effective and applicable for remote training? We can testify that IVR is a promising training method with high effectiveness scores. However, our analysis has uncovered several gaps in the application of IVR training, like the lack of learning theories in the design process and limited metrics beyond time and scores. Additionally, our review also exposed unexplored but intriguing avenues of research, like the utilisation of biosensors for users’ data collection, haptics that increases realism and applications with remote training potential.","tags":null,"title":"A systematic review of immersive virtual reality for industrial skills training","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Unnikrishnan","Francesco Chinello","Konstantinos Koumaditis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620259200,"objectID":"6498be3e9d1a28bca3f08d03b54e21e8","permalink":"/publication/unnikrishnan-2021-industrialreview/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unnikrishnan-2021-industrialreview/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Immersive Virtual Reality Training: Three Cases from the Danish Industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Unnikrishnan","Alin Blindu","Francesco Chinello","Konstantinos Koumaditis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1620259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620259200,"objectID":"92e6ee4e4f9486cb4f1a71ce22fb42fc","permalink":"/publication/unnikrishnan-2021-buzzwire/","publishdate":"2021-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/unnikrishnan-2021-buzzwire/","section":"publication","summary":"Virtual Reality (VR) for skill training is seeing increasing interest from academia and industry thanks to the highly immersive and realistic training opportunities they offer.

Optimal arrangement of woodcut layout when done manually, faces two challenges, one being that the apprentice carpenter does not get real time feedback on how efficient their arrangement is and the second being that most are not motivated enough to do such a task (perhaps because of the cognitive load). From a pedagogical view, such a problem can be tackled with the help of elements of gamification, like giving real time feedback on performance, leaderboards for identifying the best performers (in the classroom or workplace) and additional features that enables instructors or supervisors to add and customize scenarios of their choosing.\nThis problem of optimization of material use has been tackled by the textile, sheet metal cutting and carpentry cutting machine industries for many decades and is still an active area of research in the fields of computational geometry and operations research. In a way the goal of this project is to translate this kind of “computational” efficiency found in the automation industry into human workers which could prove useful in developing nations.\nThe problem of optimizing the arrangement of the component pieces needed to be made quantifiable (for the scoring to work) while reflecting real world usefulness as well. So it was recharacterized as a problem of finding the Maximum Empty (axis-parallel) Rectangle (MER) that can be fit into the empty space remaining in the workpiece after arranging the component pieces. Though in the real world, one would not get neat rectangular pieces as leftover from the cutting process, by considering the MER we can reasonably quantify the leftover material’s utility for future use.\nShape \u0026amp; Scenario Editors \r\rShape editor\r\r\r​The shape editor lets the instructor add contour information of the shape of each wood piece into the system, which is mapped to the chilitag placed on the piece.

What underlies an acknowledged dearth of skilled labor, impeding India from reaching its potential, are issues of quality, standardization, and accessibility to skill development, especially to and within existing vocational training programs. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reiterated the urgent need for improved inclusion in skill development among socially and economically vulnerable groups to strengthen the prospect of decent employment and income generation, as indicated in the sub-goal of SDG 4 on quality education. Skill development practitioners and academicians recognize information communication and technology (ICT) as a critical component in addressing issues of inclusivity, quality, and standardized skill development. Discussion of ICT-integrated TVET primarily takes place in the context of formal training; however, a significant portion of skill development in India takes place along the lifelong learning continuum, outside of the formal context. This chapter, therefore, takes a wider perspective to review how ICT is reforming TVET delivery practices in India across formal, nonformal, and open and distance learning settings.","tags":null,"title":"Role of ICT in Enhancing Scale, Quality, and Reach of TVET in India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Parameswari Anitha","Sooraj K Babu","R Unnikrishnan","Rao R Bhavani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"18a3215441af6f02168af3cb1215ee39","permalink":"/publication/anitha-2018-scratching/","publishdate":"2019-10-25T11:52:45.448503Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anitha-2018-scratching/","section":"publication","summary":"Technologies for development have great potential in accelerating the socio-economic progress of disadvantaged communities.
