  &lt;h4&gt;There are two tangible objects, one representing a toilet and the other the soak pit. AR tags placed on top enable tracking of the objects using an overhead camera. Both control the poses of their virtual avatars on the laptop&lt;/h4&gt;

      <title>TUI for Carpentry Planning Skills</title>

&lt;p&gt;Optimal arrangement of woodcut layout when done manually, faces two challenges, one being
that the apprentice carpenter does not get real time feedback on how efficient their arrangement
is and the second being that most are not motivated enough to do such a task (perhaps
because of the cognitive load). From a pedagogical view, such a problem can be tackled with
the help of elements of gamification, like giving real time feedback on performance,
leaderboards for identifying the best performers (in the classroom or workplace) and additional
features that enables instructors or supervisors to add and customize scenarios of their
choosing.
This problem of optimization of material use has been tackled by the textile, sheet metal cutting
and carpentry cutting machine industries for many decades and is still an active area of
research in the fields of computational geometry and operations research. In a way the goal of
this project is to translate this kind of “computational” efficiency found in the automation industry
into human workers which could prove useful in developing nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem of optimizing the arrangement of the component pieces needed to be made
quantifiable (for the scoring to work) while reflecting real world usefulness as well. So it was
recharacterized as a problem of finding the Maximum Empty (axis-parallel) Rectangle (MER)
that can be fit into the empty space remaining in the workpiece after arranging the component
pieces. Though in the real world, one would not get neat rectangular pieces as leftover from the
cutting process, by considering the MER we can reasonably quantify the leftover material’s
utility for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;shape-editor&#34;&gt;Shape Editor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​This module (Fig. 2) lets the instructor add contour information of the shape of
each wood piece into the system, which is mapped to the chilitag placed on the piece. The
contour data is stored into a YML file as (x,y) offsets from the position of the chilitag’s center.
Image processing tasks here were implemented using OpenCV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario-editor&#34;&gt;Scenario Editor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​This module lets the instructor associate a group of shapes to a scenario using
their chilitags.
Game ​: The objective of the game is to maximize the size of the MER that can be formed from
the area left empty. Two interfaces were implemented for visualizing the MER, one in a virtual
representation of the workpieces (using Unity3D) and the other by overlaying the MER on top of
the live video stream itself. The ​CGAL​ library was used to find the MER.&lt;/p&gt;
